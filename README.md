# ‚öΩ Data-Driven Analysis of Football Passing Patterns

## üìå Project Overview
This project leverages **data analysis** and **pass clustering** to gain deeper insights into key aspects of football tactics, focusing on how teams progress the ball into the **final third** through passing (excluding carries).  

Using **three seasons of Premier League data**, I conducted an in-depth comparison between the **'Big 6'** clubs and teams fighting relegation, analyzing their approach to breaking into attacking areas. Using pass clustering, I divided all of the passes into the final third into 29 distinct groups.

Additionally, I performed a **targeted analysis of Manchester City**, simulating the role of a Chelsea analyst, to understand their passing dynamics ahead of their Premier League match against Chelsea on January 25, 2025. The main goals were identifying:
- **Key danger zones and City's most dangerous players**  
- **Passing patterns of these players**  
- **Who initiates and receives passes in crucial areas**  
- **How City exploits half-spaces (zones 11 & 25)**  
- **Origins of passes leading to City's most frequent goal-scoring areas (#9 zone)**  
- **Where assists, second assists, and third assists come from**  
- **Haaland's role in City's passing game**  
- **Comparison of Haaland with strikers who contribute more to build-up play (e.g., Kane, Firmino, Havertz)**  
- **How goal-scoring patterns change based on where strikers receive passes**  

To support this analysis, I also developed an **Expected Threat (xT) model** for Manchester City, helping to quantify the effectiveness of different passing patterns in creating goal-scoring opportunities.  

This project blends **data-driven tactics, clustering techniques, and advanced analytics**, offering valuable insights into how elite teams construct attacks. üöÄ
